2. Using the built-in math routines 
***********************************

sqrt error number is Unknown error
sqrt of -2 is -2147483648

divide by zero error number is Interrupted function call
4 divided by zero is: -2147483648

natural log of negative number error is: Unknown error
natural log of -2 is: -2147483648

1.0e18 + 4 - 1.0e18 is: 
No error

Fixing problem: 
1.0e18 - 1.0e18 + 4 is: 4
Interrupted function call

3. Pointers to functions
